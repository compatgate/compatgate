# @compatgate/core

Finds JavaScript syntax and APIs that your browserslist targets do not support.

This package holds the core and its Node binding. Use it through `@compatgate/eslint`
or `@compatgate/bundler`, or call it directly.

## Usage

```js
import { check } from '@compatgate/core';

const result = check(source, { filename: '/project/src/app.ts' });
for (const finding of result.findings) {
  console.log(finding.feature, finding.start, finding.unsupported);
}
```

`check` finds the browserslist config and `compatgate.jsonc` above `filename`.
Pass `targets` or `allow` to skip the lookup.

## compatgate.jsonc

The file lists the features that you may use beyond your targets.
The linter and the bundler read the same file, so an entry works in both places.

```jsonc
{
  "extends": ["@company/compat-allow"],
  "allow": [
    // Closed by a core-js polyfill in the bundler
    "api.URLSearchParams.size",

    // Only for the code of these packages
    { "feature": "api.ResizeObserver", "packages": ["some-lib"] },

    // Only for these files, relative to this config
    { "feature": "api.ResizeObserver", "files": ["src/desktop/**"] }
  ]
}
```

A feature id is the full path of the feature in
[@mdn/browser-compat-data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data).
Copy it from the message of a finding.

Do not suppress findings with linter comments such as `// oxlint-disable-next-line`.
The bundler checks the code after transpilation and does not see these comments,
so the linter passes and the build fails. Use `files` in `compatgate.jsonc` instead.
